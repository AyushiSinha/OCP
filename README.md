This code shows how to use FindReticula. FindReticula annotates axoplasmic reticula (AR) in neural EM data. This example downloads a cube of neural EM data (AC4), annoates AR, and upload the annotations. 

Run mexScript.m to compile C++ code, and take a look at example.m to see how to use FindReticula.
